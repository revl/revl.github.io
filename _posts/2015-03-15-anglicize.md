I've just come across an anonymous post on an obscure forum.
The post is as entertaining as it is informative.
I couldn't have put it better myself:

Nailed it.

But hey, there's no need to hold out hope for language reforms.
I have [a script that not only removes diacritics, but
also transliterates non-Latin characters into English
phonemes](https://github.com/revl/anglicize). Problem solved.
