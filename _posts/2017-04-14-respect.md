I would go as far as to say that, as a feeling that we can have to one
another, respect is more valuable than love or affection. We don't have
to earn love to be loved, but we have to earn respect to be respected.

And it takes a lot to earn respect, while sometimes it takes just one
misstep to erode it.

All too often people who have achieved success, especially financial
success, feel entitled to be respected. You know who I'm talking about...
