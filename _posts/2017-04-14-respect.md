title: "On respect"
---

I have a strong opinion that, as a feeling that we can have to one
another, respect is more valuable than love or affection. Generally, we
don't have to earn love to be loved, but we do have to earn respect to be
respected.

And it takes a lot to earn respect, while sometimes it takes just a few
missteps to erode it.

All too often people who have achieved success, especially financial
success, feel entitled to be respected. Well, newsflash! Money brings
you wealth - not respect, at least not in my book.

Nobody is ever entitled to respect, not even our parents. It can only be
earned through deeds of character. Period.
